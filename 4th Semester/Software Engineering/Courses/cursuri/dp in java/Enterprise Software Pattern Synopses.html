<a name="Transaction Patterns"></a>Transaction Patterns</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<a name="ACID Transaction"></a><b>ACID Transaction</b></li>

<br>Ensure that a transaction will never have any unexpected or inconsistent
outcome. You do that by ensuring that the transaction has the ACID properties:
atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability.

<p>Related patterns are
</p><ul>
<li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses.htm#Snapshot">Snapshot</a></li>

<br>The Snapshot pattern describes techniques for saving and restoring
the state of objects. This is the better way to recover from a transaction
failure when a transaction involves a long sequence of operations that
modify the state of a small number of simple objects.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses.htm#Command">Command</a></li>

<br>The command pattern describes techniques for remembering and undoing
a sequence of operations. This is the better way to recover from a transaction
failure when a transaction involves a short sequence of operations that
modify the state of a large number of complex objects.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses3.htm#Audit%20Trail">Audit Trail</a></li>

<br>Logging a sequence of operations to support the Command Pattern is
structurally similar to maintaining an audit trail.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses2.htm#System%20Testing">System Testing</a></li>

<br>The System Testing pattern should be used to ensure the consistency
of transactions.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses2.htm#Unit%20Testing">Unit Testing</a></li>

<br>The Unit Testing pattern may also help to ensure the consistency of
transactions.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses.htm#Single%20Threaded%20Execution">Single Threaded
Execution</a></li>

<br>The Single Threaded Execution Pattern can be used to keep transactions
that modify the state of the same object isolated from each other, so that
the modifications each transaction makes to the object’s state do not interfere
with each other.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses.htm#Read/Write%20Lock">Read/Write Lock</a></li>

<br>The Read/Write Lock pattern can be used to keep transactions that use
the same object isolated from each other while allowing transactions that
do not modify the object’s state to execute concurrently.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses3.htm#Read/Write%20Consistency">Read/Write Consistency</a></li>

<br>If you directly manage the storage of persistent distributed objects,
you may need the Read/Write Consistency pattern to ensure that data and
objects that are read from files are consistent wit the most recent write
operation.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses.htm#Proxy">Copy on Write Proxy</a></li>

<br>The Copy on Write Proxy pattern can be used to help ensured the isolation
property of transactions. The Copy on Write Proxy is described as part
of the write-up of the Proxy pattern in Volume 1.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses2.htm#Copy%20Mutable%20Parameters">Copy Mutable Parameters</a></li>

<br>The Copy Mutable Parameters pattern can be used to help ensure the
isoplation property of transactions.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses2.htm#Return%20New%20Objects%20from%20Accessor%20Method">Return
New Objects from Accessor Method</a></li>

<br>The Return New Objects from Accessor Method pattern (described in Volume
2) can be used to help ensure the isolation property of transactions.

<p>Return Mutable Objects from Accessor Method
<br>The Return Mutable Objects from Accessor Method (described in Volume
2) can be used to help ensure the isolation property of transactions.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses3.htm#Cache%20Consistency">Cache Consistency</a></li>

<br>If you directly manage the storage of persistent distributed objects,
you may need the Cache Consistency pattern to ensure that the result of
a locally initiated read operation matches the current contents of a remote
store.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses.htm#Decorator">Decorator</a></li>

<br>If an object that does not support access controls such as single threaded
execution or read/write lock must participate in an ACID transaction, the
object’s deficiency can be compensated for by making the TransactionManager
access the object through a decorator object.
<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<li>
<a name="Composite Transaction"></a><b>Composite Transaction</b></li>

<br>You want to design and implement transactions correctly and with a
minimum of effort. Simple transactions are easier to implement and make
correct than complex transactions. Design and implement complex transactions
from simpler ACID transactions.

<p>Related patterns are
</p><ul>
<li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses3.htm#ACID%20Transaction">ACID Transaction</a></li>

<li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses.htm#Command">Command</a></li>

<br>The Command Pattern can be the basis for an undo mechanism used to
undo operations and restore object to the state they were in at the beginning
of a transaction.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses2.htm#Composed%20Method">Composed Method</a></li>

<br>&nbsp;The Composed Method pattern is a coding pattern that describes
a way of composing methods from other methods that is structurally similar
to the way the Composite Transaction pattern composes transactions.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses3.htm#Lock%20File">Lock File</a></li>

<br>&nbsp;The Lock File pattern can be used to enforce the isolation property
for a composite transaction.</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses3.htm#Two%20Phase%20Commit">Two Phase Commit</a></li>

<br>The Two Phase Commit pattern can be used to ensure the ACID properties
of a composite transaction composed from simpler ACID transactions.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses3.htm#Mailbox">Mailbox</a></li>

<br>When there is a need to ensure the reliability a composite transaction,
you will want to take steps to ensure the reliability of the component
transactions that constitute it. If the composite transaction is distributed,
you will also want to ensure the reliable transmission of messages between
the objects that participate in the transaction by such means as the Mailbox
pattern.
<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<li>
&nbsp;<a name="Two Phase Commit"></a><b>Two Phase Commit</b></li>

<br>If a transaction is composed of simpler transactions, you want them
to either all complete successfully or to all abort, leaving all objects
as they were before the transactions. You achieve this by making an object
responsible for coordinating the transactions so that they all complete
successfully or all abort.

<p>Related patterns are
</p><ul>
<li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses3.htm#ACID%20Transaction">ACID Transaction</a></li>

<br>The Two Phase Commit pattern is used to build composite transactions
having the ACID properties from component transactions that have the ACID
properties.

<li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses3.htm#Heartbeat">Heartbeat</a></li>

<br>The Heartbeat pattern may be used with the Two Phase Commit pattern
to ensure that the Coordinator object is able to detect catastrophic failures
of component transactions in a bounded amount of time.
<br>&nbsp;</ul>
<a name="Audit Trail"></a><b>Audit Trail</b>
<br>You need to verify that transactions are being processed correctly
and honestly. Maintain an historical record of transactions that have been
applied to an object or set of objects. The record should contain enough
detail to determine how the objects affected by the transactions reached
their current state.

<p>Related patterns are
</p><ul>
<li>
<a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~antoy/Courses/Patterns/www.mindspring.net/%257Emgrand/pattern_synopses3.htm#ACID%20Transaction">ACID Transaction</a></li>

<br>If the transactions in an historical record do not have the ACID properties,
then it may not be possible to unambiguously determine the effect of each
transaction on an object.

<br>The Flywieght pattern describes a way that objects with no intrinsic
state can be shared by local clients.
<br>&nbsp;</ul>
<a name="Broker"></a><b>Object Request Broker</b>
<br>Objects in a distributed environment need to call methods of remote
objects. Provide an infrastructure that allows objects in a distributed
environment to call each other’s methods, receive the results of those
calls or exceptions thrown from those calls. The infrastructure allows
remote calls to be made through an interface, with most of the details
of the call handled automatically by the infrastructure.

implementation of the Object Request Broker pattern can use the Thread
Pool pattern to recycle threads and avoid the expense of creating new threads.</ul>

<li>
<a name="Object Replication"></a><b>Object Replication</b></li>

<br>You need to improve the throughput or availability of a distributed
computation. A distributed computation is a computation that involves objects
that reside on multiple computing elements and are able to communicate
with each other. In some circumstances, it is possible to improve the availability
and throughput of a computation by replicating an object onto multiple

<br>You don’t want hackers to be able to gain access to servers containing
sensitive information if they are able to compromise the security of a
publicly accessible server. Put servers that are accessible to the public
Internet on a publicly accessible LAN that connects with bothbetween your

the attributes and then lazily download the attributes on an as needed
basis.
