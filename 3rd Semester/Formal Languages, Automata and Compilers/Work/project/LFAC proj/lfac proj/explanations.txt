It is important to note that these functions are used to implement the semantic analysis, symbol table, and other features of the language, such as error handling and type checking.

It looks like the code uses a file to store the variables and their types, which is read by the functions above. These functions are used to check whether a variable has already been declared, to check the type of a variable, and to print the value of an expression. The function Print(char *str, int value) is not related to the requirements.
