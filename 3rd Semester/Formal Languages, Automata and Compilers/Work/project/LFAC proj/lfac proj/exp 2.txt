It is important to note that these functions are used to implement the semantic analysis, symbol table, and other features of the language, such as error handling and type checking.

It looks like the code uses a file to store the variables and their types, which is read by the functions above. These functions are used to check whether a variable has already been declared, to check the type of a variable, and to print the value of an expression. The function Print(char *str, int value) is not related to the requirements.




It seems that the code is trying to fulfill several requirements from the assignment you provided.

It defines a symbol table using the variable 'correct_compilation' to indicate whether the program has passed semantic analysis or not.
It provides semantic analysis by checking if variable and function names have been defined and if the operands in expressions have the same type.
It defines a symbol table for variable and constant identifiers, and for function identifiers. This table includes information about the type, value, and parameters of the identifiers.
It defines a structure for the program with four sections: global variables, functions, user-defined data types, and a special function representing the entry point of the program.
It defines basic data types (int, float, char, string, bool) and also array types, user-defined data types and variables, constant definitions, and function definitions.
It also implements control statements (if, for, while, etc.), assignment statements
It defines a predefined function Eval() which can take an arithmetic expression, variable or number as an argument, which is supposed to return the evaluated expression.
It also defines a predefined function TypeOf() which can take an argument and return its type.
It is using a function called "cautaNume" to check if a variable/function has been defined before, and it's using write to write the symbol table to 2 files.

It is defining a main function called 'S' which checks if the compilation is correct and prints the result.

It also uses snprintf to format the string to be written to file, and it's using structs to define the symbol table.

Overall, this code is defining a programming language using YACC and is using semantic analysis to ensure that the language is well-formed, it is also creating a symbol table for the program and implementing several predefined functions such as Eval() and TypeOf().


s - entry point

progr - 

declaratii_globale - var globale
variabila - variabile int float char string bool







Sure, here is a breakdown of the functions in the YACC code and which requirement they fulfill:

The function S: This function serves as the entry point of the program and checks if the compilation is correct by checking the value of the variable correct_compilation. It prints the result of the compilation process, whether the language is accepted or if there is an error.

The function progr: This function defines the structure of the program and its sections: global variables, functions, user-defined data types and a special function representing the entry point of the program.

The function declaratii_globale: This function defines global variables and constants, it also writes the symbol table of the variables to the file 'symbol_table.txt'

The function declaratie: This function defines the different types of declarations that are allowed in the program, including variables, constant definitions, user-defined data types, and function definitions.

The function variabila: This function defines the basic data types (int, float, char, string, bool) and it also writes the symbol table of the variables to the file 'symbol_table.txt'

The function variabila_declarata: This function defines variables that are declared and initialized with a value. It also writes the symbol table of the variables to the file 'symbol_table.txt'

The function obiect: This function defines user-defined data types, similar to classes in object-oriented languages. It also writes the symbol table of the variables to the file 'symbol_table_functions.txt'

The function array: This function defines array types and writes the symbol table of the variables to the file 'symbol_table.txt'

The function definitie: This function defines function definitions and writes the symbol table of the variables to the file 'symbol_table_functions.txt'

The function metoda: This function defines methods for user-defined data types. It also writes the symbol table of the variables to the file 'symbol_table_functions.txt'

The function cautaNume: This function is used to check if a variable/function has been defined before, it helps to fulfill the requirement of checking that variables are defined only once and that functions are defined before being called.

The function Eval: This function takes an arithmetic expression, variable or number as an argument, it is supposed to return the evaluated expression.

The function TypeOf: This function takes an argument and returns its type.

It is important to note that this code may not be complete and may not fully implement all the requirements of the assignment, but it's a good starting point to understand what the code is trying to do.
